<ul>
    <li> Earth is the third planet from the sun in our solar system. Its name comes from the the old English and Germanic words meaning ‘the ground</li>
 <li>Our amazing planet has been around for quite some time. By researching our planet’s rocks, scientists have calculated the Earth to be around 4.5 billion years old!</li> 
<li> Like all the planets, Earth orbits (travels around) around the sun. And it does so at some serious speed <br> around 30 kilometres per second, in fact! It takes 365 days (one year) for the Earth to complete one full orbit.</li>
<li>Not only does Earth zoom through space, it also spins on its axis. The result? We have daytime and nighttime!<br> As the planet rotates, the side facing the sun receives daylight and the the other is in darkness.</li>
